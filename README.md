# Night-In

## Description 

As a person who is scared of the coronavirus, I want to go to a website where I can find a movie, recipe and a drink so that I don't have to intereact with the public.  

### Future Improvements:
* Find a movie API that will allow us to search by the plot of a movie
* Find an API that has the ability to search for specific drinks or by ingredient


## Installation

Here's a link to the deployed app: 
[Link to Night-In App](https://mtgovern.github.io/Night-In/)


## Usage 

```
GIVEN a night-in dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a meal
THEN I am presented with recipes with the name of the meal and a movie theme consistent with the name of the meal.
WHEN I search for ingredients that I have in my kitchen
THEN I am presented with recipes with those ingredients
WHEN I click on Random Drink
THEN I am presented with the name of the drink and the ingredients to make it
```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
